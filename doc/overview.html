<h2>Overview</h2>

Gear is a geometry description toolkit for ILC reconstruction software. It is easy to use and 
lightweight. Gear defines an abstract interface for the description of an ILC detector as needed for
the development of particle flow algorithms. This description is somewhat different from the geometry
description needed for the detailed simulation of the detector response, though of course related.
For the simualtion one needs very detailed knowledge of the material distribution in space whereas for the
reconstruction mostly a higher level description of the subdetector's charcteristics is needed.
Depending on the particular reconstruction algorithm a hand full of parameters might suffice to describe
a full subdetector, e.g. the main calorimeters - certainly a lot less than waht is needed for the
computation of the detailed detector response with geant4. The aim of Gear is now to provide the interface
this recosntruction view of the detector geometry.

A first implementation uses XML files 
for the definition of the subdetector's geometry parameters. Currently under development is an
implementation for the abstract interface to generic material properties in space, like the 
material's  density at a given point or the integrated B-field along a (straight) path 
between two points. 
 
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
At the core of the geometry description in gear is the class gear::GearMgr. An instance of that class 
provides the user with available implementations of the various sub-interfaces, e.g. an instance of 
gear::TPCParameters. All subdetector interfaces inherit from gear::GearParameters - this allows to store 
arbitrary named parameters of simple types and vectors of such types within any subdetector parameter 
interface. Also generic named parameter sections can be used through this interface, e.g in case a 
particular subdetector type has not yet been implemented in gear.
<p>
In the current implementation XML-files are used to provide the subdetector parameters to Gear.
The user code however only applies the abstract interface and is thus independent from the XML-file
implementation.
<p>
Gear is written in C++. However the abstract interface classes are written using the
<a href="http://www.freehep.org/">AID tool.</a> which allows to also create Java interface files
from the same source.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Gear is available for download at <a href="http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/lc-cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gear/?cvsroot=gear">http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/lc-cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gear/?cvsroot=gear</a> .


 modify the env.sh  ( path to java ! ) and then source it:
 
  . env.sh
<code>
   ant aid.generate <br> 
   ant cpp <br>
   ant cpp.doc <br>
</code>
 

<h2>Example code</h2>
The file  <b>./src/cpp/test/testgear.cc</b> serves as a simple test and example program.
Also the <em>print</em>-methods in <b>./src/cpp/gearimpl/src/Util.cc</b> are a good starting point  
for learning  how to access the information in Gear.
<p>
Here is an <a href="../../gear_ldc.xml">example XML-file</a> with a detector description in gear.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
